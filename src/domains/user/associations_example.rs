// Example: How the new ergonomic association system would work
// This replaces 400+ lines of repetitive association code with ~30 lines

use crate::framework::entity::associations::*;
use crate::domains::user::EntUser;
use crate::domains::post::EntPost;
use crate::domains::group::EntGroup;
use crate::error::AppResult;

// Before: 400+ lines of repetitive association methods
// After: Simple macro-based definitions

define_associations!(EntUser => {
    friends -> EntUser as "friends",
    followers -> EntUser as "followers", 
    following -> EntUser as "following",
    posts -> EntPost as "posts",
    liked_posts -> EntPost as "liked_posts",
    groups -> EntGroup as "groups",
    blocked_users -> EntUser as "blocked_users",
    pending_friend_requests -> EntUser as "pending_friend_requests",

// Usage examples - much more ergonomic:

/*
// Before (old way):
let friends = user.get_friends().await?;
let friend_count = user.count_friends().await?;
user.add_friend(friend_id).await?;

// After (new ergonomic way with context):
let friends = user.friends(ctx).await?;
let friend_count = user.count_friends(ctx).await?;
user.add_friend(ctx, friend_id).await?;

// Advanced queries:
let recent_posts = AssociationQuery::new(&user, "posts")
    .limit(10)
    .execute(ctx)
    .await?;

// Generic associations work for any type:
let custom_entities: Vec<CustomEntity> = user
    .get_associated(ctx, "custom_relationship", Some(50))
    .await?;
