# AI Development Changelog

This directory contains detailed changelog documents for all AI-driven development tasks performed on the TAO system. Each file captures comprehensive context to enable reproducibility and maintain system understanding across different AI agents.

## File Naming Convention

Use incremental naming similar to database migrations:

```
001_initial_feature.md
002_enhancement_or_fix.md
003_next_major_change.md
...
```

## Purpose

These changelog files serve multiple critical purposes:

1. **Context Preservation** - Maintain full context for future AI agents
2. **Decision Documentation** - Record why technical decisions were made
3. **Reproducibility** - Enable recreation of changes from documentation
4. **System Evolution** - Track how the system has evolved over time
5. **Knowledge Transfer** - Help developers understand the system's history

## How to Use

### For AI Agents:
1. **Before starting work**: Read recent changelog files to understand current state
2. **During implementation**: Copy the template from `../templates/task_template.md`
3. **Name your file**: Use the next incremental number (e.g., if latest is 005, use 006)
4. **Fill completely**: Document everything - reasoning, changes, patterns, decisions
5. **Update as you work**: Fill the Implementation Log section as you make changes

### For Developers:
- Read these files to understand how the system evolved
- Use them to understand why certain architectural decisions were made
- Reference them when making related changes
- Follow established patterns documented in previous changes

## Template Location

The master template is located at: `../templates/task_template.md`

**IMPORTANT**: Never modify the template directly. Always copy it to create new changelog entries.

## Quality Standards

Each changelog file should include:
- Complete problem analysis and context
- Detailed solution design with reasoning
- File-by-file change documentation
- Testing strategy and results
- Performance impact analysis
- Future considerations and tech debt notes

## Current System State

To understand the current state of the TAO system, read:
1. The main project documentation in `../gemini.md`
2. Recent changelog files (start with the highest numbered file)
3. The system architecture overview in the project root

## Maintenance

This directory should grow incrementally with each significant change to the system. Never delete or modify existing changelog files - they serve as permanent historical records of system evolution.
